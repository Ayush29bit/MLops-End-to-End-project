# MLops-End-to-End-project
An end to end computer vision project with MLops principles like using MLflow for experimentation ,DVC for data versioning and CI/CD pipeline deployment

This project is a complete end-to-end data mining and machine learning pipeline built to predict chest diseases from patient data. It is a classification problem, combining data preprocessing, experimentation, model tracking, pipeline automation, and deployment into one cohesive workflow.
The project demonstrates not only data science and deep learning proficiency, but also MLOps best practices using DVC for versioning, CI/CD pipelines for modular training and deployment, and a robust, scalable architecture ready for production.
